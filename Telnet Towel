Install Homebrew 

- Install Telnet using Homebrew by running the following command in the Terminal:


/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)" brew install telnet


- Once the installation is complete, you can run the infamous "telnet towel" command as usual:


telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl



- This will allow you to watch Star Wars Episode IV in ASCII art in the Terminal


******Please note that Telnet was removed from macOS with Catalina, so using Homebrew is the recommended method for installing it on newer versions of macOS********
